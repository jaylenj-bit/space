      <h2>Black Holes</h2>
      <p>Black holes are extremely dense regions in space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape their pull. They are formed when massive stars collapse under their own gravity at the end of their life cycles. Despite being invisible, black holes can be detected by observing their effects on nearby matter, such as stars or gas clouds being pulled in. There are different types of black holes, including stellar, supermassive, and intermediate, with supermassive black holes found at the centers of most galaxies, including our Milky Way. Black holes remain one of the most mysterious and fascinating phenomena in the universe, challenging our understanding of space, time, and physics.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Exoplanets</h2>
      <p>Exoplanets, or extrasolar planets, are planets that orbit stars outside of our solar system. Thousands have been discovered using telescopes and advanced detection methods like the transit and radial velocity techniques. These planets vary widely in size, composition, and orbital distance, with some resembling Earth and others being gas giants larger than Jupiter. Scientists study exoplanets to learn more about planetary formation and the potential for life beyond Earth. Some lie in their star’s habitable zone, where conditions might allow liquid water to exist, making them prime candidates in the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>
    </div>

     <div class="card">
      <h2>Wormholes</h2>
      <p>Wormholes are hypothetical tunnels in space-time that could connect distant parts of the universe, acting like shortcuts through space. Predicted by Einstein’s theory of general relativity, wormholes are often depicted in science fiction as gateways for faster-than-light travel. While they are mathematically possible, no physical evidence of their existence has been found. If they do exist, wormholes would likely be extremely unstable and require exotic matter with negative energy to stay open. Despite being purely theoretical, wormholes remain a fascinating concept in both physics and the imagination of scientists and storytellers.</p>

     <div class="card">
      <h2> Dark Matter & Dark Energy</h2>
      <p>Dark matter and dark energy are mysterious substances that make up most of the universe, yet they cannot be seen directly. Dark matter, which accounts for about 27% of the universe, does not emit or absorb light, but its presence is inferred from its gravitational effects on galaxies and galaxy clusters. Dark energy, making up roughly 68% of the universe, is thought to be responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe. Unlike dark matter, dark energy acts as a repulsive force. Together, these two components dominate the cosmos, while ordinary matter—the stuff we can see—makes up less than 5%, leaving much of the universe’s true nature still unknown.</p>

      <h2>The James Webb Space Telescope</h2>
      <p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a powerful space observatory launched in December 2021 to succeed the Hubble Space Telescope. Designed to observe the universe in infrared light, JWST can see through dust clouds and capture incredibly detailed images of distant galaxies, stars, and exoplanets. Its advanced instruments allow scientists to study the formation of the first galaxies, the atmospheres of exoplanets, and the origins of stars and planetary systems. Positioned about a million miles from Earth, JWST offers an unprecedented view of the cosmos, helping to answer some of the most fundamental questions about the universe’s history and structure.</p>

     <div class="card">
      <h2>The Search for Extraterrestrial Life</h2>
      <p>The search for extraterrestrial life involves exploring the universe for signs of living organisms beyond Earth. Scientists focus on planets and moons that may have conditions suitable for life, such as liquid water, the right temperature range, and essential chemical elements. This search includes studying exoplanets in habitable zones, analyzing the atmospheres of distant worlds for potential biosignatures, and exploring places like Mars, Europa, and Enceladus within our solar system. Additionally, projects like SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) use radio telescopes to listen for possible signals from intelligent civilizations. While no definitive evidence has been found yet, the search continues to be one of the most intriguing and hopeful areas of space science.</p>

     <div class="card">
      <h2>Star System Analysis</h2>
      <p>Star system analysis is the study of stars and their surrounding celestial bodies, such as planets, moons, asteroids, and comets, to understand how these systems form, evolve, and interact. Scientists use telescopes and space probes to observe light, motion, and chemical signatures from stars and their companions. By analyzing binary star systems, multi-star systems, and planetary orbits, researchers can learn about gravitational dynamics, star lifecycles, and planet formation. This analysis also helps identify potentially habitable planets and understand the structure and diversity of systems beyond our own solar system. Star system analysis is essential to advancing our knowledge of the universe and our place within it.</p>
